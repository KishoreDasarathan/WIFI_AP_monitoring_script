# Unifi AP Monitoring Python Script

This Python script is part of a project I am working on during my working as a **Network & Security Trainee**. The script is designed to monitor **Unifi Access Points (APs)** and provides insights into the connection status and data consumption of devices connected to the network.,This Python script helps monitor Unifi Access Points (APs) by tracking the connection status of devices. It shows when a device connects or disconnects from the AP and provides data usage statistics for each device.

## Features

- **Device Connection Status**: Tracks when a device connects or disconnects from the Unifi Access Point.
- **Data Consumption**: Monitors how much data each connected device has consumed over time.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides real-time updates of device status and data usage.
